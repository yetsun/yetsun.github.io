Take aways about JMeter
In JMeter Junit sampler,
Each loop will call

- the @Before setup method
- the @Test method

     (No constructor nor static method are called for each loop)
     This means the loop reuse the same object and calling itâ€™s test methods

Each thread will call
     constructor
     This means each threads will use its own object

static method are called only one time
     This means the threads share the same JVM. Classes are loaded only one time.
